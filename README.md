In this project I experiment with the following technologies and ideas:
- node server, react web front end and react-native mobile app are written in typescript
- I use webpack for building the backend and the web front end. The mobile app should also be built with webpack, due to some issues with the haul project it is postponed for now.
- Graphql is used in back and front ends
- Communication to the database is also done using graphql with the help of prisma project
- The UI components are wrapped so that the screens can be shared between the mobile and web interfaces
- Server, web and mobile modules all use the same package.json file
- Server is dockerized
